In theoretical systems, it requires modelling by stochastic differential equations, whose solutions can be analytically intractable except for the simplest of Gaussian processes. Research on classical and quantum systems has revealed, however, that noise is essential when boosting hidden signatures by the phenomenon known as stochastic resonance. Many different methods proposed for inducing stochastic resonance are now revolutionizing measurement and modeling in fields as wide ranging as nonlinear optics and photonics, quantum communication, SQUID devices, neurophysiology, hydrodynamics, climate research and finance.

In the first term, the student should be fully engaged in, and make significant progress on, the research project. In the second term, the research continues and an outline of the thesis itself should be reviewed with the adviser and the option representative. In the third term, research work continues to completion and the focus turns to thesis writing. A thesis document of 20-100 pages must be completed and approved by the adviser and the option representative before the end of third term. The student and advisor should maintain good communication regarding the scope, content, draft due dates, and final copy of the thesis.

The scope of the course includes imaging and spectroscopic observational techniques at optical and infrared wavelengths. The format centers on projects and practical skills but also includes a lecture and problem set component to establish the theoretical underpinnings of the practical work. Specific course components include: (a) Students will learn to use small, portable telescopes and find and image objects of interest using finder charts; (b) Students will build basic data reduction pipelines for imaging and spectroscopy data to understand how these types of data are used to derive scientific results; (c) Students will use Palomar Observatory to propose and execute their own research projects focused on astrophysical or planetary topics; (d) Students will query and work with data from on-line archives and catalogs. The class meets twice a week during the daytime plus one weekly evening telescope session, and has a required field trip to Palomar Observatory. Students interested in enrolling should review the logistical information on this page and ensure their schedule allows attendance of all course components prior to registering: https://dekleer.caltech.edu/ayge107.

These various processes, collectively known as checkpoint-regulatory mechanisms, lie at the heart of how organisms maintain genomic integrity throughout their lifetimes. These pathways are essential for the prevention of cancer, birth defects, and other maladies. As part of the course, students will give presentations on key publications in the field, including both classic papers and newer papers that employ cutting-edge technologies.",

    "description": "Application of Atomistic-based methods to predicting the structures and properties of molecules and solids and for simulating the dynamical properties. It is aimed at experimentalists and theorists interested in learning how to apply atomistic theory to understanding structures, properties, and dynamics of molecules and solids. This course emphasizes hands-on use of modern commercial software (such as Jaguar or ORCA for QM on molecules, VASP for QM on periodic systems, and LAMMPS for MD) for practical applications and in such areas as catalysis (heterogeneous, homogeneous, and electrocatalysis), semiconductors (group IV, III-V, surfaces, defects), organo-metallics,  inorganic systems (ceramics, zeolites, superconductors, and metals), biological systems (proteins, DNA, carbohydrates, lipids), and polymers (crystals, amorphous systems, co-polymers). The first 5 weeks of Ch 121a covers the basic methods of QM and MD with hands-on applications to systems using modern software. For the midterm each student proposes a short research project to use atomistic simulations for a problem that has not yet been published. For the second 5 weeks of Ch 121a each student addresses this research project with a weekly 5-10 min presentation on progress. The final is a 5 page report on the results. In Ch 121b each student selects a more extensive research project (could be an extension of the Ch 121a project) and uses atomistic simulations to solve it. The final is a draft of a paper for publication.",

Beginning with feedback linearization and the stabilization of feedback linearizable system, these concepts are related to control Lyapunov functions (CLF), and corresponding stabilization results in the context of optimization-based controllers.    This leads to control barrier functions (CBFs), which enforce safety on nonlinear systems via safety filters.  The interplay between stability (CLFs) and safety (CBFs) will be studied from a variety of perspectives.  Advanced topics that build upon these core results will be discussed, including: robust, adaptive and event-triggered control, layered control architectures, model-predictive control and hybrid systems.  The control of robotic systems will be used as a motivating example.",

We will then ask whether critical axioms of neoclassical models are plausible by calling upon psychological insights and empirical data. Rejection of neoclassical axioms will lead to new models, behavioral economics models, in each setting. These models, mechanisms and their testable predictions will be discussed.",

This first part delves into Consumer Choice Theory, where students will explore how individuals make consumption decisions based on their preferences, budget constraints, and the theory of utility maximization. Through a series of lectures and exercises, participants will learn to model consumer behavior and study how changes in market conditions affect consumer demand.  Simultaneously, the course will cover Firm Theory, examining how firms make production and pricing decisions to maximize profits in competitive and non-competitive markets. Students will be introduced to the concepts of production functions, cost minimization, and profit maximization, alongside the analysis of market structures and their impact on firm behavior. This dual focus provides a comprehensive foundation for understanding the interactions between consumers and firms, setting the stage for more complex discussions on market equilibria, welfare economics, and policy implications in later parts of the course (Ec 121b).  Through a blend of theoretical models and real-world applications, this course aims to develop critical thinking and analytical skills, preparing students for advanced studies in economics or careers that require a sophisticated understanding of how economies function at equilibrium.",

STEM research strives for objectivity and replicability, and key genres of STEM research writing require that writers repress their subjectivity and individuality. However, a researcher's experience of inquiry is often deeply personal and emotional, and some researchers choose to write about those experiences in personal essays and memoirs. We will analyze a wide variety of this narrative writing, and we will examine connections between the narratives' formal features and the rhetorical effects they might have on readers. Drawing on what we learn, students will compose an excerpt of their own memoir or a stand-alone personal narrative essay. The course will also explore current approaches to spoken storytelling sometimes utilized by researchers, such as the Moth story and the TED talk.

Who has access to education? What does an ideal education consist in? And ultimately: What is a university for? As we think through these questions we will read op/eds and investigative journalism in addition to fiction, and we will consider a variety of university-centered topics (determined by student interest) including issues of gender, class, privilege, race, and genius. Authors read may include Sayers, Larkin, Amis, C.P. Snow, Lodge, and Zadie Smith.",

The hapless protagonist of Don Quixote calls into question the boundaries between sanity and madness, truth and falsehood, history and fiction, objectivity and individual experience. What might be modern, perhaps even revolutionary, in Cervantes's dramatization of the moral and material dilemmas of his time? Conducted in English.",

At this time, two small European kingdoms, Spain and Portugal, first conducted trade and conquest in Atlantic Africa, the Americas, and the Indian and Pacific Oceans, forging the world's first truly global empires. We study the legacy of racism and humanitarianism in eye-witness accounts, maps, images and other materials attesting to Spain's seminal encounters with the Americas.",

We will discuss how historians write about the environment in the past, how they approach the interactions of states and societies with the environment, as well as examining what and how people in the past knew about their environments. The course will stretch chronologically and geographically and cover a broad range of topics from Graeco-Roman Antiquity in the Mediterranean, through the early modern Atlantic world, to the early nineteenth-century United States. We will examine people's interactions with climate, forests, waterways, wildlife, and natural disasters, to name just a few themes, and learn how societies understood, described, and managed the natural world in premodern times.",

    "description": "In the middle of the seventh century, the tribal followers of a new religion called Islam burst out of the deserts of the Arabian Peninsula and rapidly overwhelmed the armies of the ancient Byzantine and Sassanid Empires. By the middle of the next century, they had conquered much of the western Eurasian world, from the Central Asian steppe to the Straits of Gibraltar. The Muslims' extraordinary achievement bound together lands formerly ruled by two ancient empires-the Roman and Persian-and transformed the cultures, societies, economies, and laws of the diverse peoples now subject to their rule. This course explores the political, social, and institutional history of the Islamicate world from its origins in seventh-century Arabia to the Ottoman conquest of Constantinople in 1453. It will pay particular attention to relations between Islam and the other cultures of the Mediterranean as they are revealed in episodes such as the conquest of Spain, the Crusades, and repeated conflicts with the Byzantine Empire. It will also explore internal political, cultural, and religious conflict among the followers of Islam themselves.",

The course will investigate how instruments emerged, interacted, and contributed to evolving scientific paradigms. Special attention will be given to the unexpected role played by now-obsolete scientific traditions-ranging from alchemy and astrology to Aristotelian meteorology-in influencing the design and function of some of the most revolutionary scientific instruments in history. A key component of the course will be hands-on learning: students will analyze and reconstruct historical instruments using replicas and digital tools, including 3D-printed models, and visit museum, library, and archive collections.",

Our focus will be on the extinction of biological entities, but we will also touch on other systems that have disappeared: languages, technologies, habitats, and ways of living. Central to our endeavors will be asking what it means to live in this time of loss: Should we mourn? And if so, how do we mourn for what many or most of us do not see, but only read about? Finally, we will scrutinize what the practical effects of extinction have been, are, and will be. We will also make at least one visit to a natural history museum to view some extinct species behind the scenes.",

CFD and FEA topics covered include meshing, types of elements, steady and unsteady solvers, inviscid and viscous flow, internal and external flow, drag and lift, static and dynamic mechanical loading, elastic and plastic behavior, and vibrational (modal) analysis. Fluid mechanics laboratory experiments introduce students to the operation of a water tunnel combined with laser particle image velocimetry (PIV) for quantified flow field visualization of velocity and vorticity. Solid mechanics experiments introduce students to the operation of a mechanical (axial/torsional) load frame combined with digital image correlation (DIC) and strain gage transducers for quantification and full field visualization of displacement and strain. Technical writing skills are emphasized through the generation of detailed full-length lab reports using a scientific journal format.",

This course explores ways that composers have tried to express specific ideas through sound at various points in history. We will investigate the musical techniques composers have used in these efforts, as well as a variety of theories from the past and present about music and meaning.

We start with some early history of experimental economics. Methodological discussions include principles of randomization, internal validity, statistical power, between- and within-subject designs, generalizability, field experiments, and reproducibility. Applications include testing theories of risk and time preference, non-cooperative games, market trading, auctions, and AI.

    "description": "This course examines surveillance, one of the defining features of twenty-first-century life, with wide-ranging implications (from intelligence gathering and biometrics to social media and contemporary art), and a key point of intersection between modern technology and visual culture. Though it applies more broadly, the concept of \"surveillance,\" from the Latin vigilare (\"to watch\") and the French surveiller (\"to watch over\"), originated in practices of looking and observation that still define many of its most significant practices today. Building on these etymological roots, we will treat surveillance as, first and foremost, a visual practice and survey the longer history of surveillance (and counter-surveillance) techniques as well as the theories that have emerged to describe its social effects, moral and ethical stakes, and changing legal status.",

We will draw upon theory and practices from art, science, geography and landscape studies to critically analyze how artists, scientists, corporations, government agencies, activists, and local inhabitants use environmental imagery for diverse purposes with sometimes conflicting interests. Each term will center on a specific theme related to California and climate change, for example, water or energy. The course includes projects, lectures, readings, discussions and a 2-day field trip. Students will learn to think critically while developing creative, culturally complex approaches to observing, recording, and representing the natural world.",
