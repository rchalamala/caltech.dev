    "description": "Noise is often regarded as a nuisance. In experimental systems, it diminishes signal to noise ratio and obfuscates patterns and weak signals. In theoretical systems, it requires modelling by stochastic differential equations, whose solutions can be analytically intractable except for the simplest of Gaussian processes. Research on classical and quantum systems has revealed, however, that noise is essential when boosting hidden signatures by the phenomenon known as stochastic resonance. Many different methods proposed for inducing stochastic resonance are now revolutionizing measurement and modeling in fields as wide ranging as nonlinear optics and photonics, quantum communication, SQUID devices, neurophysiology, hydrodynamics, climate research and finance. This course, designed to appeal to theorists and experimentalists alike, is conducted in survey and seminar style. Review of the current literature will be complimented by lectures and readings focused on statistical physics and stochastic processes.",

Its overarching goal is to enable students to develop intuition about a diversity of real measurement systems and the means to critically evaluate them. This involves developing a standard framework for estimating the ultimate and practical limits to information that can be extracted from a real measurement system. Topics will include the fundamental nature of information and signals, physical signal transduction and responsivity, the physical origin of noise processes, modulation, frequency conversion, synchronous detection, signal-sampling techniques, digitization, signal transforms, spectral analyses, and correlation methods. The first term will cover the essential underpinnings, while second-term topics will vary year-by-year according to interest. Among possible Ph 118 b topics are: high frequency, microwave, and fast time-domain measurements; biological interfaces and biosensing; the physics of functional brain imaging; and quantum measurement.\n Part b not offered 2024-25.",

Students wishing assistance in finding an adviser and/or a topic for a senior thesis are invited to consult with the astronomy option representative. The student will work with an adviser to formulate a research project, conduct original research, present new results, and evaluate them in the context of previously published work in the field. In the first term, the student should be fully engaged in, and make significant progress on, the research project. In the second term, the research continues and an outline of the thesis itself should be reviewed with the adviser and the option representative. In the third term, research work is completed and the focus should turn to thesis writing. A written thesis of 20-100 pages must be completed and approved by the adviser and the option representative before the end of third term. The student and advisor should maintain good communication regarding the scope, content, draft due dates, and final copy of the thesis. First two terms are graded pass/fail, with grades updated at the end of the course to the appropriate letter grade for all three terms.",

    "description": "This hands-on, project-based course covers the design, proposal, and execution of astronomical observations, the basics of data reduction and analysis, and interacting with astronomical survey catalogs. The scope of the course includes imaging and spectroscopic observational techniques at optical and infrared wavelengths. The format centers on projects and practical skills but also includes a lecture and problem set component to establish the theoretical underpinnings of the practical work. Specific course components include: (a) Students will learn to use small, portable telescopes and find and image objects of interest using finder charts; (b) Students will build basic data reduction pipelines for imaging and spectroscopy data to understand how these types of data are used to derive scientific results; (c) Students will use Palomar Observatory to propose and execute their own research projects focused on astrophysical or planetary topics; (d) Students will query and work with data from on-line archives and catalogs. The class meets twice a week during the daytime plus one weekly evening telescope session, and has a required field trip to Palomar Observatory. Students interested in enrolling should review the logistical information on this page and ensure their schedule allows attendance of all course components prior to registering: https://dekleer.caltech.edu/ayge107.

This course introduces students to the academic and professional world of contemporary sports science. The course will meet biweekly with instructor lectures on sports science and with guest speakers from collegiate and professional sports. Students will be introduced to the primary data sources for sports science, to methods used to collect sports performance and outcomes data, and to the statistical tools used for sports analytics (for example, logistic regression, regression trees and random forest, network models, time series, and natural language processing). Students will be responsible for weekly writing or homework assignments based on readings and speaker presentations, as well as a quarter-long sports analytics research project. Students should have some background in econometrics, statistics and probability, data science, or machine learning.",

Before the beginning of the first term of the thesis, students must submit a proposal - with project details and significant design component clearly defined - for review and approval by the thesis mentor and chemical engineering Undergrad Option Rep. In addition, students must submit the following to the thesis mentor and chemical engineering senior thesis coordinator: a midterm progress report in each term; end-of-term progress reports at the end of the first two terms; and a thesis draft in the third term. A grade will not be assigned prior to completion of the thesis, which normally takes three terms. A P grade will be given for the first two terms and then changed to the appropriate letter grade at the end of the course.",

This course emphasizes hands-on use of modern commercial software (such as Jaguar for QM, VASP for periodic QM, and LAMMPS for MD) for practical applications and is aimed at experimentalists and theorists interested in understanding structures, properties, and dynamics in such areas as biological systems (proteins, DNA, carbohydrates, lipids); polymers (crystals, amorphous systems, co-polymers); semiconductors (group IV, III-V, surfaces, defects); inorganic systems (ceramics, zeolites, superconductors, and metals); organo-metallics, and catalysis (heterogeneous, homogeneous, and electrocatalysis). Ch 121 a covers the basic methods with hands-on applications to systems of interest using modern software. The homework for the first 5 weeks emphasizes computer-based solutions. For the second 5 weeks of the homework each student proposes a short research project and uses atomistic simulations to solve it. Ch 121 b each student selects a more extensive research project and uses atomistic simulations to solve it.",

Beginning with feedback linearization and the stabilization of feedback linearizable system, these concepts are related to control Lyapunov functions, and corresponding stabilization results in the context of optimization based controllers. Advanced topics that build upon these core results will be discussed including: stability of periodic orbits, controller synthesis through virtual constraints, safety-critical controllers, and the role of physical constraints and actuator limits. The control of robotic systems will be used as a motivating example.",

In each topic area we will begin by providing the standard neoclassical account for behavior, building from assumptions (axioms) to corresponding utility models. We will then ask whether critical axioms of neoclassical models are plausible by calling upon psychological insights and empirical data. Rejection of neoclassical axioms will lead to new models, behavioral economics models, in each setting. These models, mechanisms and their testable predictions will be discussed.",

STEM research strives for objectivity and replicability, and key genres of STEM research writing require that writers repress their subjectivity and individuality. However, a researcher's experience of inquiry is often deeply personal and emotional, and some researchers choose to write about those experiences in personal essays and memoirs. We will analyze a wide variety of this narrative writing, and we will examine connections between the narratives' formal features and the rhetorical effects they might have on readers. Drawing on what we learn, students will compose an excerpt of their own memoir or a stand-alone personal narrative essay. The course will also explore current approaches to spoken storytelling sometimes utilized by researchers, such as the Moth story and the TED talk.

For instance, once we set up a simile between \"world\" and \"grain of sand\", we can test this hypothesis of sameness. How is sand like the world? Where will the model fail? And what might that tell us? Imagery, sensory language, arguments, ideas, and verse form itself can lead poetry toward power and discovery. This pursuit can reach from the page into one's own life. We will work hard together on poems, our own and one another's. With permission of the instructor students may repeat the course for credit.\n Not offered 2024-25.",

Exploring both literary texts and visual representation, it considers how previous eras and cultures understood embodiment, sexuality, and gender and asks how we, as modern readers and viewers, approach these questions across the distance of centuries. We will read across a wide range of literature, including theology, philosophy, fiction, romance, and spiritual biography, and examine manuscript illustrations and other early visual media. Questions we will take up include the following: how did writers and artists construct the \"naturalness\" or \"unnaturalness\" of particular bodies and bodily acts? How did individuals understand the relationship between their own bodies and those of others? In what ways did writing and art authorize, scrutinize, or otherwise parse the boundaries of the licit and illicit? Finally, how have modern critics framed these questions? How do we approach and make use of earlier theories of sex and gender?",

Why do novels of migration so often focus on a strongly marked central character?  And why is that character so often lonely or isolated?

More specifically, it teaches graduate students about composing texts in scientific English for various audiences, focusing on issues of clarity, as well as grammar and usage. It helps familiarize writers with the features of clear and effective STEM writing, and it teaches writers about the style and genres of U.S. academic STEM writing, helping them learn to read and write about the work of others in their field. Students are encouraged to take ESL/Wr 107 in the first or second year of graduate school.",

A small number of solutions will be selected as winners, granting those students permission to register. This course demonstrates how research ideas arise, are evaluated, and tested and how the ideas that survive are developed. Weekly group discussions and one-on-one meetings with faculty allow students to delve into cutting edge scientific research. Ideas from physics are used to think about a huge swath of problems ranging from how to detect life on extrasolar planets to exploring the scientific underpinnings of science fiction in Hollywood films to considering the efficiency of molecular machines. Support for summer research at Caltech between an undergraduate's first and sophomore years will be automatic for students making satisfactory progress. Graded pass/fail.

Comparison with contemporary developments in Egypt during the Old and Middle Kingdoms may include a reading of Gilgamesh from 3000 B.C.E. and of the Egyptian Tale of Sinuhe. The course concludes with a discussion of life during the late Bronze Age. Focus will be on life as it was lived and experienced by many groups in pre-classical antiquity rather than on kings and dynasties.",

What is the changing role of science and technology?

Extinction has been viewed in changing ways over the past 200 years, and this course takes an interdisciplinary approach to learning about the extinction process from a historical as well as a modern perspective. Our focus will be on the extinction of biological entities, but we will also touch on other systems that have disappeared: languages, technologies, habitats, and ways of living. Central to our endeavors will be asking what it means to live in this time of loss: Should we mourn? And if so, how do we mourn for what many or most of us do not see, but only read about? Finally, we will scrutinize what the practical effects of extinction have been, are, and will be. We will also make at least one visit to a natural history museum to view some extinct species behind the scenes.",

Colleagues of Einstein, such as Max Born, Hans Bethe, Enrico Fermi, Lise Meitner, Erwin Schrodinger, and untold numbers of students, scientists, and engineers were forced out of their universities and laboratories by the rise of Fascism in Europe and sought shelter in the United States and elsewhere. Many contributed to the Allied World War II effort. Einstein himself became a facilitator for immigrant scientists, intellectuals, and artists seeking refuge. We shall use historical documents from the Einstein Archives to understand the complex collective and individual experiences and their impact on developments in science and technology during this turbulent historical period.",

CFD and FEA topics covered include meshing, types of elements, steady and unsteady solvers, inviscid and viscous flow, internal and external flow, drag and lift, static and dynamic mechanical loading, elastic and plastic behavior, and vibrational (modal) analysis. Fluid mechanics laboratory experiments introduce students to the operation of a water tunnel combined with laser particle image velocimetry (PIV) for quantified flow field visualization of velocity and vorticity. Solid mechanics experiments introduce students to the operation of a mechanical (axial/torsional) load frame combined with digital image correlation (DIC) and strain gage transducers for quantification and full field visualization of displacement and strain. Technical writing skills are emphasized through the generation of detailed full-length lab reports using a scientific journal format.",

These artworks address issues of sustainability, extraction and marginalization that affect vulnerable human bodies and the non-human world. We will then use ecological and feminist methods to create personal artworks. This class will use the resources of the Huntington Botanical Garden, and potentially field trips for plein air works on major local energy infrastructure sites.",

At best, the Global South is an addendum to this narrative - a place photography happens to, rather than a site of visual innovation. Taking an alternative approach to the canon, this course centers non-Western image cultures in the history and theorization of the medium, following the camera as it travels from the studios of colonial bureaucrats in Rajasthan through the struggle against South African apartheid to Tunisia's smartphone revolution. Adopting a global and comparative lens, students will read classic works of photographic theory alongside anticolonial philosophy, fiction, and art manifestos, exploring how a familiar medium has been repeatedly re-imagined and re-invented to suit new contexts and meet new needs. Ultimately, we'll ask how widening our field of view can expand our understanding of photography, shifting how we read images more broadly.",
