In the first part, we begin by reviewing geometrical optics before transitioning to the scalar theory of optical waves. Using linear system analysis and Fourier transforms, we study a range of topics, including diffraction, optical beams, resonators, and imaging systems. In the second part of the course, we explore the concepts of coherence and polarization and apply them to the study of a broader range of phenomena and systems where a full electromagnetic field description is necessary. This includes topics such as photonic crystals, meta-surfaces, and nonlinear optical processes.",

This course will start by examining the biology of processes such as how plants and animals colonize oceanic islands and the physics of how animals such as wildebeest form giant herds during their year-long migration.  With these wonders of the living world revealed, we will then seek to understand biological phenomena by thinking about genes and cells.

We will start from a historical overview of Chinese finance and will study the institutions that drive financial market development. Next, we will focus on the unique economic features of the three main channels of Chinese finance: capital markets (including the stock and bond markets), bank- and fund-based intermediation (including the banking sector, shadow-banking, and private equity, and venture capital), and informal finance. Finally, we will study the opportunities and challenges posed by Chinese-style finance for the future development of the global financial system.",

Before the beginning of the first term of the thesis, students must submit a proposal - with project details and significant design component clearly defined - for review and approval by the thesis mentor and chemical engineering Undergrad Option Rep. In addition, students must submit the following to the thesis mentor and chemical engineering senior thesis coordinator: a midterm progress report in each term; end-of-term progress reports at the end of the first two terms; and a thesis draft in the third term. A grade will not be assigned prior to completion of the thesis, which normally takes three terms. A P grade will be given for the first two terms and then changed to the appropriate letter grade at the end of the course.",

Ch 121 a covers the basic methods with hands-on applications to systems of interest using modern software. The homework for the first 5 weeks emphasizes computer-based solutions. For the second 5 weeks of the homework each student proposes a short research project and uses atomistic simulations to solve it.

    "description": "This class treats Shannon's mathematical theory of communication and the tools used to derive and understand it. The class is organized around fundamental questions and their solutions, leading to central results such as Shannon's source coding, channel coding, and rate-distortion theorems. Quantities that arise en route to these solutions include entropy, relative entropy, and mutual information for discrete and continuous random variables. The course explores the calculation of fundamental communication limits like entropy rate, capacity, and rate-distortion functions under a variety of source and communication channel models (e.g., memoryless, Markov, ergodic, and Gaussian). The course begins with a foundational discussion of the simplest communication scenarios and then expands to include topics like universal source coding, the role of side information in source coding and communications, and the generalization of earlier results to network systems. Network information theory topics include multiuser data compression and communication over multiple access channels, broadcast channels, and multiterminal networks. Philosophical and practical implications of the theory are also explored. This course, when combined with EE 112, EE/Ma/CS/IDS 127, EE/CS 161, and EE/CS/IDS 167, should prepare the student for research in information theory, coding theory, wireless communications, and/or data compression.\n Part b not offered 2024-25",

CS/EE/IDS 143 and CMS/CS/EE/IDS 144 study how they work and the \"big\" ideas behind our networked lives. In this course, the questions explored include: Why is an hourglass architecture crucial for the design of the Internet? Why doesn't the Internet collapse under congestion? How are cloud services so scalable? How do algorithms for wireless and wired networks differ? For all these questions and more, the course will provide a mixture of both mathematical analysis and hands-on labs. The course expects students to be comfortable with graph theory, probability, and basic programming.",

The course takes a bottom-up approach: a series of compilers will be built, all of which generate assembly code for x86 processors, with each compiler adding features. The final compiler will compile a full-fledged high-level programming language to assembly language. Topics covered include register allocation, conditionals, loops and dataflow analysis, garbage collection, lexical scoping, and type checking. This course is programming intensive. All compilers will be written in the OCaml programming language.",

The question of what - if anything - makes us different from animals was debated from numerous points of view: including talking dogs, philosophizing women, bestial men, humanlike beasts, and other creatures that defied the conventions of the time. This course explores some of the key literary texts that shaped this debate and pays careful attention to their cultural environments.

Starting from an overview of the observed state of the atmosphere and its variation over the past, the course discusses Earth's radiative energy balance including the greenhouse effect, Earth's orbit around the Sun and climatic effects of its variations, and the role of atmospheric circulations in maintaining the energy, angular momentum, and water balances, which determine the distributions of temperatures, winds, and precipitation. The focus throughout is on order-of-magnitude physics that is applicable to climates generally, including those of Earth's past and future and of other planets.",

The course is divided into three parts that address various aspects of the marine carbon cycle, including carbon and tracer transport by the ocean circulation, carbonate chemistry, and fixation/respiration of carbon by biological processes. These parts are tied to three key questions that highlight the ocean's role in the global climate system:  What processes contribute to changes in global and local sea level?  How and where does the ocean exchange carbon dioxide with the atmosphere?  Why is a warming climate associated with ocean acidification and what are the biological consequences?  The course will also provide perspectives on how we observe and model the ocean and how these tools are used in climate predictions.",

The data from these instruments are often freely available on the web. Anyone can do things like study x-rays from pulsars in our galaxy or gamma rays from distant galaxies using data from Swift and Fermi; discover planets eclipsing nearby stars using data from Kepler; measure the expansion of the universe using supernovae data; study the cosmic microwave background with data from Planck; find gravitational waves from binary black hole mergers using data from LIGO; and study the clustering of galaxies using Hubble data. We will explore some of these data sets and the science that can be extracted from them. A primary goal of this class is to develop skills in scientific computing and visualization.

Weekly group discussions and one-on-one meetings with faculty allow students to delve into cutting edge scientific research. Ideas from physics are used to think about a huge swath of problems ranging from how to detect life on extrasolar planets to exploring the scientific underpinnings of science fiction in Hollywood films to considering the efficiency of molecular machines.

Working through primary sources, students will explore the relationship between violence and vengeance, the law, central authority and public order, religion, emotions, public ritual, and economics.

The course will look at how familiar concepts (e.g. the cell, evolution, the gene) were shaped by scientific workers' adoption of different methods and materials. This approach will allow us to situate biological inquiries within wider political and cultural contexts, while also drawing our attention to the way instruments mediated perceptions in the recording of observations and the execution of experiments. We will trace continuities and changes in the kinds of questions that naturalists and biologists posed, survey spaces in which they pursued their work, and become acquainted with a variety of humans, nonhuman organisms, chemicals, and machines assembled in these spaces. These exercises will familiarize us with diverse forms of labor in and beyond laboratories that have contributed to how humans understood the living world.",

    "description": "Our literary tradition in the West goes back to the troubadours, who were the first poets writing in a spoken language (i.e. not Latin) who have had a continuous influence ever since. Who were these poets, and why did what they created have such a decisive impact? Some have claimed that the troubadours invented our basic assumptions about the relations between the self and the world. Certainly they affected ideas about the status of women, since they sang of poets in service to their unattainable ladies. We shall examine the troubadours' interactions with their religious culture, showing how they were affected by Islam and Christianity, and how in turn they helped prepare the early thirteenth century explosion of religious mysticism. Our aim is to assess their contribution to building the basis for modern culture. We shall analyze how these poets developed a unique concept of subjectivity that made it possible for the self to acquire emotional knowledge about the world. In turn, that emotional basis became a foundation for the self that acquires scientific knowledge.",

    "description": "Creating the emotional self may have been as significant for the modern project as was formulating an appropriate theory of knowledge. One source for the modern conception of the self lay in the mystical tradition. We shall examine Medieval mysticism, beginning with Saint Francis of Assisi and continuing through the Dominican followers of Meister Eckhardt. We shall also look at the Dutch mystic Jan van Ruusbroec, and then turn our attention to the woman mystics, such as, for example, Marguerite Porete, Julian of Norwich, and Margery Kempe. Finally we shall examine the sixteenth century Spanish mystics, St. John of the Cross and St. Teresa of Avila. Our focus will be on the way these mystics think about themselves in relation to God. We shall try to find out whether the conceptions of the self in this tradition have anything to do with how we think about the self.",

It will look at works that raise the issue of veracity and storytelling, including fictions like Graham Swift's Waterland, films such as Kurosawa's Rashomon, and the \"historical novellas\" in Simon Schama's book Dead Certainties. It will also investigate in some detail the works of American, French, and Italian historians who have tried to solve this problem by turning to so-called microhistory. Not offered 2014-15.",

Extinction has been viewed in changing ways over the past 200 years, and this course takes an interdisciplinary approach to learning about the extinction process from a historical as well as a modern perspective. Our focus will be on the extinction of biological entities, but we will also touch on other systems that have disappeared: languages, technologies, habitats, and ways of living. Central to our endeavors will be asking what it means to live in this time of loss: Should we mourn? And if so, how do we mourn for what many or most of us do not see, but only read about? Finally, we will scrutinize what the practical effects of extinction have been, are, and will be. We will also make at least one visit to a natural history museum to view some extinct species behind the scenes.",

Colleagues of Einstein, such as Max Born, Hans Bethe, Enrico Fermi, Lise Meitner, Erwin Schrodinger, and untold numbers of students, scientists, and engineers were forced out of their universities and laboratories by the rise of Fascism in Europe and sought shelter in the United States and elsewhere. Many contributed to the Allied World War II effort. Einstein himself became a facilitator for immigrant scientists, intellectuals, and artists seeking refuge. We shall use historical documents from the Einstein Archives to understand the complex collective and individual experiences and their impact on developments in science and technology during this turbulent historical period.",

How should society be organized?) and normative questions (e.g., Is eating meat morally acceptable? What should we tolerate and why? What are society's obligations toward the poor?). In addition, the psychological and neural substrates of moral judgment and decision making may be explored. The course draws on a variety of sources, including selections from the great works of moral and political philosophy (e.g., Aristotle's Nichomachean Ethics, Hobbes's Leviathan, Kant's Groundings for a Metaphysics of Morals, and Rawls's A Theory of Justice), contemporary discussions of particular moral issues, and the science of moral thought.",

In this course we will explore how visual culture shapes our lives and daily experiences, and we will learn to find wonder in its rich details.

The course is focused on staying safe while rendering an assailant temporarily unable to give chase to allow the student to get help. Techniques taught will assist students in learning vulnerable targets to disable an attacker, using their own body to maximize damage to allow escape, and finding methods to generate force. Using an assailant's attack against him to maintain balance and administer the greatest degree of force necessary to disable a threat is the foundation of the course.",

    "description": "This course offers a focused introduction to the practices of reading, thinking, and writing that characterize academic writing. More specifically, the course teaches students how to articulate a position, situate writing within specific contexts, engage with the work of others, locate and provide convincing evidence, and understand the expectations of different types of academic readers. Students will take several writing projects through multiple stages of revision, improving their work with feedback from seminar discussions, workshops, and frequent one-to-one conferences with the instructor. Students are placed in Wr 2 based on a writing assessment that is required of all incoming students; successful completion of the course is required before taking first-year humanities courses. Enrolled students may be required to take Wr 3, 4, and/or 50 in subsequent quarters.",
