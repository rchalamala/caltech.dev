Using linear system analysis and Fourier transforms, we study a range of topics, including diffraction, optical beams, resonators, and imaging systems. In the second part of the course, we explore the concepts of coherence and polarization and apply them to the study of a broader range of phenomena and systems where a full electromagnetic field description is necessary. This includes topics such as photonic crystals, meta-surfaces, and nonlinear optical processes.",

In the second term, the research continues and an outline of the thesis itself should be reviewed with the adviser and the option representative. In the third term, research work is completed and the focus should turn to thesis writing. A written thesis of 20-100 pages must be completed and approved by the adviser and the option representative before the end of third term. The student and advisor should maintain good communication regarding the scope, content, draft due dates, and final copy of the thesis.

With these wonders of the living world revealed, we will then seek to understand biological phenomena by thinking about genes and cells.

Course material will primarily feature readings and videos on a case study-like basis and focus on bringing conversations typically had in humanities, social sciences and activism to the bio and geosciences. Topics will center around two primary approaches: an \"outward-facing\" component that looks at environmental racism through the lens of various activisms, and an \"inward-facing\" component addressing the biases/malpractices broadly employed in the biological and geosciences, as well as the apparent moral dilemmas of decisions involving multiple stakeholders. Out of class work will largely be based on assigned readings, some multimedia presentations, and occasional writings and thought exercises.

We will start from a historical overview of Chinese finance and will study the institutions that drive financial market development. Next, we will focus on the unique economic features of the three main channels of Chinese finance: capital markets (including the stock and bond markets), bank- and fund-based intermediation (including the banking sector, shadow-banking, and private equity, and venture capital), and informal finance. Finally, we will study the opportunities and challenges posed by Chinese-style finance for the future development of the global financial system.",

At the end of the third term, students enrolled in Ch 82 will present a thesis of approximately 20 pages (excluding figures and references) to the mentor and the Chemistry Curriculum and Undergraduate Studies Committee. The thesis must be approved by both the research mentor and the CUSC. An oral thesis defense will be arranged by the CUSC in the third term for all enrollees. The first two terms of Ch 82 will be taken on a pass/fail basis, and the third term will carry a letter grade.",

This course emphasizes hands-on use of modern commercial software (such as Jaguar for QM, VASP for periodic QM, and LAMMPS for MD) for practical applications and is aimed at experimentalists and theorists interested in understanding structures, properties, and dynamics in such areas as biological systems (proteins, DNA, carbohydrates, lipids); polymers (crystals, amorphous systems, co-polymers); semiconductors (group IV, III-V, surfaces, defects); inorganic systems (ceramics, zeolites, superconductors, and metals); organo-metallics, and catalysis (heterogeneous, homogeneous, and electrocatalysis). Ch 121 a covers the basic methods with hands-on applications to systems of interest using modern software. The homework for the first 5 weeks emphasizes computer-based solutions. For the second 5 weeks of the homework each student proposes a short research project and uses atomistic simulations to solve it. Ch 121 b each student selects a more extensive research project and uses atomistic simulations to solve it.",

    "description": "This class treats Shannon's mathematical theory of communication and the tools used to derive and understand it. The class is organized around fundamental questions and their solutions, leading to central results such as Shannon's source coding, channel coding, and rate-distortion theorems. Quantities that arise en route to these solutions include entropy, relative entropy, and mutual information for discrete and continuous random variables. The course explores the calculation of fundamental communication limits like entropy rate, capacity, and rate-distortion functions under a variety of source and communication channel models (e.g., memoryless, Markov, ergodic, and Gaussian). The course begins with a foundational discussion of the simplest communication scenarios and then expands to include topics like universal source coding, the role of side information in source coding and communications, and the generalization of earlier results to network systems. Network information theory topics include multiuser data compression and communication over multiple access channels, broadcast channels, and multiterminal networks. Philosophical and practical implications of the theory are also explored. This course, when combined with EE 112, EE/Ma/CS/IDS 127, EE/CS 161, and EE/CS/IDS 167, should prepare the student for research in information theory, coding theory, wireless communications, and/or data compression.\n Part b not offered 2024-25",

The course will be based in readings from both classic and modern research. Methodologically, the course will combine both theoretical and empirical evidence of the mentioned above topics.\n Not offered 2024-25.",

Data analysis for its own sake is often quite boring, but becomes crucial when it supports claims about the world. A convincing data analysis starts with the collection and cleaning of data, a thoughtful and reproducible statistical analysis of it, and the graphical presentation of the results. This course will provide students with the necessary practical skills, chiefly revolving around statistical computing, to conduct their own data analysis. This course is not an introduction to statistics or computer science. I assume that students are familiar with at least basic probability and statistical concepts up to and including regression.",

These include pumping carbon dioxide into geologic reservoirs or ultramafic rocks, stimulating biospheric growth, enhanced mineral weathering, soil carbon accumulation, biomass burial on land or at sea, and others. We will examine these strategies in detail, looking at both the science and technology that enable them to work, as well as their potential biogeochemical ramifications for Earth's global systems if pursued at scale. The class is structured as a tutorial, in which small groups of students meet individually with the instructor, and topics are presented by the students. Each student will write papers, give presentations, and lead discussions on 3 topics throughout the term. Course will be limited to 12 participants, who will be selected at the start of the term based on background, interests, and willingness to commit to the entire term. Undergrads only.

The course is divided into three parts that address various aspects of the marine carbon cycle, including carbon and tracer transport by the ocean circulation, carbonate chemistry, and fixation/respiration of carbon by biological processes. These parts are tied to three key questions that highlight the ocean's role in the global climate system:  What processes contribute to changes in global and local sea level?  How and where does the ocean exchange carbon dioxide with the atmosphere?  Why is a warming climate associated with ocean acidification and what are the biological consequences?  The course will also provide perspectives on how we observe and model the ocean and how these tools are used in climate predictions.",

We will explore some of these data sets and the science that can be extracted from them. A primary goal of this class is to develop skills in scientific computing and visualization.

A small number of solutions will be selected as winners, granting those students permission to register. This course demonstrates how research ideas arise, are evaluated, and tested and how the ideas that survive are developed. Weekly group discussions and one-on-one meetings with faculty allow students to delve into cutting edge scientific research. Ideas from physics are used to think about a huge swath of problems ranging from how to detect life on extrasolar planets to exploring the scientific underpinnings of science fiction in Hollywood films to considering the efficiency of molecular machines. Support for summer research at Caltech between an undergraduate's first and sophomore years will be automatic for students making satisfactory progress. Graded pass/fail.

Working through primary sources, students will explore the relationship between violence and vengeance, the law, central authority and public order, religion, emotions, public ritual, and economics. As they go along students will consider whether violence can coexist with or even promote stable, ordered societies, or whether it by definition creates disorder.\n Not offered 2024-25.",

The course will look at how familiar concepts (e.g. the cell, evolution, the gene) were shaped by scientific workers' adoption of different methods and materials. This approach will allow us to situate biological inquiries within wider political and cultural contexts, while also drawing our attention to the way instruments mediated perceptions in the recording of observations and the execution of experiments. We will trace continuities and changes in the kinds of questions that naturalists and biologists posed, survey spaces in which they pursued their work, and become acquainted with a variety of humans, nonhuman organisms, chemicals, and machines assembled in these spaces. These exercises will familiarize us with diverse forms of labor in and beyond laboratories that have contributed to how humans understood the living world.",

Who were these poets, and why did what they created have such a decisive impact? Some have claimed that the troubadours invented our basic assumptions about the relations between the self and the world. Certainly they affected ideas about the status of women, since they sang of poets in service to their unattainable ladies. We shall examine the troubadours' interactions with their religious culture, showing how they were affected by Islam and Christianity, and how in turn they helped prepare the early thirteenth century explosion of religious mysticism. Our aim is to assess their contribution to building the basis for modern culture. We shall analyze how these poets developed a unique concept of subjectivity that made it possible for the self to acquire emotional knowledge about the world. In turn, that emotional basis became a foundation for the self that acquires scientific knowledge.",

One source for the modern conception of the self lay in the mystical tradition. We shall examine Medieval mysticism, beginning with Saint Francis of Assisi and continuing through the Dominican followers of Meister Eckhardt. We shall also look at the Dutch mystic Jan van Ruusbroec, and then turn our attention to the woman mystics, such as, for example, Marguerite Porete, Julian of Norwich, and Margery Kempe. Finally we shall examine the sixteenth century Spanish mystics, St. John of the Cross and St. Teresa of Avila. Our focus will be on the way these mystics think about themselves in relation to God. We shall try to find out whether the conceptions of the self in this tradition have anything to do with how we think about the self.",

It will look at works that raise the issue of veracity and storytelling, including fictions like Graham Swift's Waterland, films such as Kurosawa's Rashomon, and the \"historical novellas\" in Simon Schama's book Dead Certainties. It will also investigate in some detail the works of American, French, and Italian historians who have tried to solve this problem by turning to so-called microhistory. Not offered 2014-15.",

Extinction has been viewed in changing ways over the past 200 years, and this course takes an interdisciplinary approach to learning about the extinction process from a historical as well as a modern perspective. Our focus will be on the extinction of biological entities, but we will also touch on other systems that have disappeared: languages, technologies, habitats, and ways of living. Central to our endeavors will be asking what it means to live in this time of loss: Should we mourn? And if so, how do we mourn for what many or most of us do not see, but only read about? Finally, we will scrutinize what the practical effects of extinction have been, are, and will be. We will also make at least one visit to a natural history museum to view some extinct species behind the scenes.",

Colleagues of Einstein, such as Max Born, Hans Bethe, Enrico Fermi, Lise Meitner, Erwin Schrodinger, and untold numbers of students, scientists, and engineers were forced out of their universities and laboratories by the rise of Fascism in Europe and sought shelter in the United States and elsewhere. Many contributed to the Allied World War II effort. Einstein himself became a facilitator for immigrant scientists, intellectuals, and artists seeking refuge. We shall use historical documents from the Einstein Archives to understand the complex collective and individual experiences and their impact on developments in science and technology during this turbulent historical period.",

How should society be organized?) and normative questions (e.g., Is eating meat morally acceptable? What should we tolerate and why? What are society's obligations toward the poor?). In addition, the psychological and neural substrates of moral judgment and decision making may be explored. The course draws on a variety of sources, including selections from the great works of moral and political philosophy (e.g., Aristotle's Nichomachean Ethics, Hobbes's Leviathan, Kant's Groundings for a Metaphysics of Morals, and Rawls's A Theory of Justice), contemporary discussions of particular moral issues, and the science of moral thought.",

In this course we will explore how visual culture shapes our lives and daily experiences, and we will learn to find wonder in its rich details. In doing so, we will develop the visual literacy that Moholy-Nagy envisioned: essential skills in reading, analyzing, discussing, and writing about visual materials and their circulation through the physical and virtual networks that structure our world.",

More specifically, the course teaches students how to articulate a position, situate writing within specific contexts, engage with the work of others, locate and provide convincing evidence, and understand the expectations of different types of academic readers. Students will take several writing projects through multiple stages of revision, improving their work with feedback from seminar discussions, workshops, and frequent one-to-one conferences with the instructor. Students are placed in Wr 2 based on a writing assessment that is required of all incoming students; successful completion of the course is required before taking first-year humanities courses. Enrolled students may be required to take Wr 3, 4, and/or 50 in subsequent quarters.",
